[00:19.78] The not source of the matrix a should be.
[00:20.80] Zero.
[00:32.51] So we said even events though this problem looks simple, but it's still
[00:36.39] Solution really depends on the structure of the A matrix itself. Right?
[00:40.47] Purchase of a. For example, if
[00:42.96] our a matrix is a tall matrix
[00:50.90] Right? So assuming that this is m by n, that means m should be greater than n. So if
[00:55.07] m by n. This is the case where everybody saying m is
[00:56.74] greater than n.
[01:00.58] So this is the case we call.
[01:06.23] Over the time
[01:06.56] Right? So this is an over determined case.
[01:08.65] I'm... So let's assume that.
[01:17.89] Let's assume that the columns are linearly independent
