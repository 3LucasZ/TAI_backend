[00:02.56] Ten
[00:08.32] is a named series, candidate, party percent, and so on that all have the same
[00:13.94] index. They all have the same index, the sort of standard default index,
[00:15.63] starting at zero to the number of rows minus one.
[00:16.77] Kane.
[00:20.46] So how do we actually create a data frame? There's a number of ways to do this.
[00:22.45] Number of ways to create a data frame.
[00:24.17] Again,
[00:26.72] need to memorize every single way to create a data frame.
[00:28.46] Should be familiar with them
[00:31.03] But believe me when I need to create a data frame,
[00:36.68] if there's a particular way I need to do it, that's not just a standard way, like, reading in a Csv that will see
[00:37.27] a minute,
[00:38.01] look it up.
[00:39.95] Or ask a large language model for help.
[00:41.89] Okay. Alright. So
[00:43.95] syntax we're creating a data frame,
[00:45.37] something like this.
[00:48.54] P e dot data frame. P dot data frame.
[00:56.64] I'm passing in some data, some index in some columns.
[01:02.45] And so there's a couple different ways to do this The first way of constructing
[01:04.29] A data frame is from Csv file.
[01:06.55] Again, understanding this syntax.
[01:09.13] Is more important than memorizing it.
[01:14.07] Again, we look up, you know, basic syntax all the time. Important thing
[01:16.61] Knowing precisely how to code something,
[01:18.94] less important and I talked about this last time.
[01:20.17] Then knowing
[01:21.30] what you want.
[01:26.55] Than knowing what you want. And this is one of the great things about large language models is if you know what you want,
[01:30.20] the next step has become a lot easier. The knowing what you want step
[01:35.77] is where you need to really do a lot of critical thinking, but L can't do that for you.
[01:39.12] But the precise how a lot of times, large language models can be super super helpful.
[01:44.85] K. So one of the first things you can do create a data frame. You'll do this all the time is you can use the Pd
[01:47.81] dot read underscore csv function,
[01:49.56] we're reading in
[01:53.18] a Csv file, a comma separated values file,
[01:54.45] from some
[01:57.05] Directory,
[01:59.28] Notice in the data folder,
[02:04.35] the data directory, and inside of it, there's a file called elections dot Csv. In the demo,
[02:05.95] if we go to the
[02:11.52] data folder. Inside of the data folder. There is a file called elections dot csv,
[02:13.10] if I double click on
[02:16.24] We can see there's comma separated values inside of.
[02:17.70] We'll come back to this.
[02:22.53] So that's a one way to create a data frame very common way of doing it.
[02:27.31] But again, in some languages, it's redo dot Csv in Pandas, it's read underscore Csv.
[02:28.95] Have to look it up on the fly,
[02:29.96] All good.
[02:31.04] K.
[02:34.82] Another way to create a data frame. You can use a list
[02:37.26] and a set of column names.
[02:38.86] So here's one way to do it.
[02:44.63] Inside of p dot data frame, the pd dot data frame construct
[02:44.94] I'm going to say create a data frame,
[02:47.25] has a single column called numbers.
[02:51.49] And inside of that numbers column include the values, one, two and three.
[02:55.47] There are the numbers one, two and three, the zero one and two,
[02:58.21] are the default index?
[03:00.89] Starting from zero, going up to the number of rows,
[03:03.29] minus one. Let's say I wanted more than one column.
[03:07.48] More than one column to create a data frame,
[03:09.41] with more than one column,
[03:11.35] we create it using
[03:13.30] Rose.
[03:15.98] I pass in a list.
[03:16.92] Where each
[03:18.32] sub list,
[03:20.25] is a row
[03:21.13] the data frame,
[03:25.91] So notice that first sub list corresponds to the number one
[03:28.45] the string one, the second sub
[03:29.79] corresponds to
[03:31.11] the number two,
[03:32.95] and the string two
[03:37.15] And what do we pass in as well. We pass in the
[03:38.59] names of the
[03:39.82] columns.
[03:45.58] Another way to build a data frame. Goal of these slides is to show you how many different ways there are
[03:47.91] to create a data frame. Pandas is very flexible. If there's
